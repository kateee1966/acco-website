Project Decription: 
Our teamâ€™s goal is to build a convenient website to help customers to reserve or rent a suitable place and allow providers to publish their accommodations. In our project, we will concentrate on implement of functional design rather than user interface design. For that reason, UI design will have lower priority. Also, implementing concrete search filter has higher priority because it is an advanced feature which other websites do not have.
