-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 1

Get familiar with the projects and do some research about them. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 2

Group formed. Some discussion and comparison about the projects, and preliminarily decided to choose 
project one --- X-o-Bot. Then discussed the basic methods and techniques we will use in the development.
Start to write the Project Proposal, I focus on the Accommonadation Request Module part. I referenced the 
Airbnb website to see the current achieved features and think of some potential features which hasn't been
achieved like more detailed searching filters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 3

Discuss about the UI design and some methods to connect the frontend and backend. Further discussed the 
project and more functions. I give some advice on how to build a more detailed search function and suggest
some filters like accommodation type (Hotel, Personal) and whether with gym.. Add the classification part 
which differentiate different type of accommondations. Do some research on Google Maps and Auto-recommendation 
and add the two features to the project, and add 2 Epics to the Proposal which describe the two features.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 4

Based on the framework of the project built by my teammate, I add some java objects and some features about 
them which will be used in the database. I check the functions of the service package and make some modifications 
and added some new functions in the Java objects in model forder. I start to think about the design of the 
database based on the requirements and functions. I also review some knowledge about SQL and primary key for 
designing the database. Learn Java Servlet and JDBC for writting backend code. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 5

Add more objects and some attributes to these objects, add the constructors, getters and setters to the objects
in the model folder. I read some source code which implements the sign in and sign up functionality written
by my teammate. Keep learning Servlet and JDBC and think about how to implement search module using these 
techniques. Continued learning about the database building techniques.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 6

Designed the tables, relations, primary keys and foreign keys for the database. Which is based on the Java
objects in the Accommodation/src/com.accommodation/model. I uploaded a draft database.txt file to github which 
guild the team to understand the whole database design. It's not strict SQL statements which should be modified
later. Install MySQL database application and make some initializations of the software to build the database.
Something weird occured to our project framework, the IDEA IDE we used has some bug when using git push. The 
src forder of our framework cannot be uploaded to github, so we gave up using github and send code to each other
through WeChat. So there will not be much commit record on github.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 7

Build database, my teammate write servlet and dao files for implementing the login and sign up functionality. 
Some bugs occured when we are trying to connect frontend and backend, I looked at the debugging process to
avoid same mistakes when implementing Search module. Continue to write code of implementing the search 
functionality. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 8

Write the backend part of implementing the searching system. As there is some inconsistent idea of the attributes
of the searching between frontend and backend, we discussed and changed some attributes of the model to unify the 
project. After finishing the backend part, we attempted to connect with frontend but encountered HTTP 500 error,
so we spent some time debuging our backend and fixed part of the problems. During the debugging time, I also find 
some frontend bugs and fixed them together with my teammate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 9

I tried a few days debugging the servlet files of the search module, I used unit tests. I searched for solutions
on stackoverflow and other websites, but still couldn't fix all of them. My backend partner helped me debug 
the code but some weird errors like multiple timezone error can't be solved, I think my framework is not very
up to date and frontend files are also not the latest. Maybe this is one of the reasons why it doesn't work 
and my teammate suggested to implement the search part instead of me. Then I got no coding work to do so I 
started to write the final report.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
week 10

I attended the lecture which overview the whole project process and assessment and also including how to write
the report. My group shared a template report and I looked into it. After understanding the structure, I wrote 
the abstract and background part of the report to make a start. As the search part is rewrote by my teammate so 
the implementation is not familiar to me so I suggest to give some feedback and correction after my teammate 
finishes this part of report. As we cannot use github to upload code so my part of search implementation is not 
online. So I uploaded 4 files I have written to the root directory which are SearchFirstServlet.java 
SearchSecondServlet.java and AccommodationDao.java and AccommodationTest.java . The first 2 files are written 
by myself. And in the Dao file, the searchLocation, searchOtherPersonal and searchOthersCompany methods are 
written by myself. AccommodationDao.java is written by myself as unit test to test and debug my search part.
I also upload the abstract and background part of the report written by myself.
